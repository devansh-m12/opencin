- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible.
- Minimize `'use client'` directives.
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals.
- Use server actions for mutations instead of route handlers.
- Use `next/image` for optimized image loading.
- All API responses must be typed with TypeScript interfaces or types.
- Use getServerSideProps or getStaticProps only when necessary; prefer server components.
- All dynamic routes must have fallback handling.
- Use absolute imports instead of relative imports for shared modules.
