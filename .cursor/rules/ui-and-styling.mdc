- All UI components must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Use semantic HTML elements wherever possible.
- All interactive elements must have focus states.
- All color choices must pass contrast checks.
- No inline styles—use Tailwind or component libraries only.
- All UI components must have Storybook stories (if Storybook is used).
- All components must be tested for keyboard navigation.
- Use Tailwind's utility classes for spacing, sizing, and layout—avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- All forms must have proper labels and ARIA attributes.
- Use Radix UI primitives for all dialogs, popovers, and tooltips.
- All images must include descriptive alt text.
- Avoid using fixed pixel values for widths/heights; use responsive units (%, rem, em, vw, vh).
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Make use of the components, hooks and utils available in `@workspace/ui/components`, `@workspace/ui/hooks` and `@workspace/ui/lib`.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Configure the Tailwind CSS theme in the `tooling/tailwind/index.js` file.
