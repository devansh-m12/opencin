- Use PascalCase for class names and type definitions.
- Utilize camelCase for variables, functions and methods.
- Employ kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Reserve UPPERCASE for environment variables and constants.
- Avoid magic numbers by defining constants with meaningful names.
- Start each function name with a verb to indicate its purpose.
- Prefix boolean variables with "is", "has", or "should".
- Use plural names for arrays and collections.
- All enums must use PascalCase for names and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for values.
