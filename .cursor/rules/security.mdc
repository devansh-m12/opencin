- All user input must be validated and sanitized.
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII).
- Use environment variables for secrets, never hardcode them.
- Use HTTPS for all network requests in production.
- All authentication tokens must be stored securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies).
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints.
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
